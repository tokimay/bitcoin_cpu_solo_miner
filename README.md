# Bitcoin solo cpu miner
python local bitcoin solo miner


**notice:**
cpu solo mode is not profitable. I can say it is impossible by current network hash rate.<br>
<h3> This code work correct but just for education purpose </h3>
reviewing code learn you the following topics: <br>

* communicate with local bitcoin core.
* calculate merkle root.
* calculate coinbase transaction (scriptSig, scriptPubkey, ...)
* generate raw block (block serialization)
* submit new block on blockchain
