# Bitcoin solo cpu miner
### Python Bitcoin CPU solo miner

**Notice:** </br>
CPU solo mode is not profitable. I can say it is ***impossible*** with the current network hash rate. </br>
This code works correctly but just for educational purposes. </br>

### Reviewing code teaches you the following topics:

* Communicate with the local bitcoin core.
* Calculate Merkel root.
* Calculate a Coinbase transaction (scriptSig, scriptPubkey, etc.).
* Generate a raw block (block serialization).
* Submit a new block on blockchain.
